## FAQ
#### How can I change  `<title>` and `meta tags`
Dynamic modification of title and meta-tags are not supported yet.   
Please open `index.html` and change them manually.

#### How to switch themes
Themes are available in the folder named `themes`  
It is possible to change between the themes which are in the `themes` folder.
**File:** `app/globals.ts` and `app/globals.js`   
if you are using npm lite-server it will re-create .js file from .ts file, otherwise plase change in the .js file
```javascript
exports.themeName = 'theme1';     // change to any available theme
```
